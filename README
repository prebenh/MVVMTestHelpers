NotifyPropertyChangedTester

If you have worked with WPF/Silverlight our any other MVVM implementation, you came a cross INotifyPropertyChanged.
What the Notify Property Changed Tester does is Testing all the public properties of a class. 
It checks if a property is set, it raises the PropertyChangedEvent with the correct property name.

This is done by reflection.
